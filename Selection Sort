Algorithm :
Selection sort is a simple and efficient sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly selecting the
smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted portion of the list and moving it its correct position in the sorted list.



Psuedo Code:

 for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++)
        {
            // Find the minimum element in unsorted array
            int min_idx = i;
            for (int j = i+1; j < n; j++)
                if (arr[j] < arr[min_idx])
                    min_idx = j;
 
            // Swap the found minimum element with the first
            // element
            int temp = arr[min_idx];
            arr[min_idx] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
        }
    }

we can modify condition in the if statement and can get the array in descending order.
