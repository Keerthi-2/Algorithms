Algorithm :
1.traverse from left to end of the array and compare adjacent elements and the higher one is placed at right side. 
2.In this way, the largest element is moved to the rightmost end at first. 
3.continue the processs till we find the second largest and place it at its position and then keep performing until the data is sorted in ascending or descending order.

Pseudo code:
to sort array in increasing order:
for (i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {


      for (j = 0; j < n - i - 1; j++) {

        if (arr[j] > arr[j + 1]) {

          // Swap arr[j] and arr[j+1] if they are not in decreasing order

          temp = arr[j];

          arr[j] = arr[j + 1];

          arr[j + 1] = temp;

    
        }

      }

To sort array in decreasing order just mention the condition in if statmenet in reverse way as arr[j]<arr[j+1]
