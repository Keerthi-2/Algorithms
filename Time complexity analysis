Time complexity is :  Big O(N*log(log(N))

where log(log(N)) is less than sqaure root of N*(Sqrt(N))

Derivation :

> According to our inner for loop logic the loop iterates only in the cases of prime numbers.

so lets assume the prime number till 20  as {  2 ,3 , 5 , 11, 13 , 17 ,19 }

âœ”  for 2 iterations will be (N/2) and for 3 itertaions will be N/3 , by this we can generalize iterations as N//K if K is a prime number .

Overall time complexity will be :  N/2+N/3+N/5+N/7+-------   by observing the pattern we can say that it is in harmonic progression (HP)

Harmonic progression : sum of the terms till a specific range but as the inverse of terms there in arithemetic progression.
