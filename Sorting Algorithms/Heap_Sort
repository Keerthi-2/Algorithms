First convert the array into heap data structure using heapify, then one by one delete the root node of the Max-heap and replace it with the last node in the heap and then heapify the root of the heap. Repeat this process until size of heap is greater than 1.

Build a heap from the given input array.
Repeat the following steps until the heap contains only one element:
Swap the root element of the heap (which is the largest element) with the last element of the heap.
Remove the last element of the heap (which is now in the correct position).
Heapify the remaining elements of the heap.
The sorted array is obtained by reversing the order of the elements in the input array.



Psuedo code:

public class HeapSort {
    public void sort(int arr[])
    {
        int N = arr.length;
 
        // Build heap (rearrange array)
        for (int i = N / 2 - 1; i >= 0; i--)
            heapify(arr, N, i);
 
        // One by one extract an element from heap
        for (int i = N - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // Move current root to end
            int temp = arr[0];
            arr[0] = arr[i];
            arr[i] = temp;
 
            // call max heapify on the reduced heap
            heapify(arr, i, 0);
        }
    }
 
    // To heapify a subtree rooted with node i which is
    // an index in arr[]. n is size of heap
    void heapify(int arr[], int N, int i)
    {
        int largest = i; // Initialize largest as root
        int l = 2 * i + 1; // left = 2*i + 1
        int r = 2 * i + 2; // right = 2*i + 2
 
        // If left child is larger than root
        if (l < N && arr[l] > arr[largest])
            largest = l;
 
        // If right child is larger than largest so far
        if (r < N && arr[r] > arr[largest])
            largest = r;
 
        // If largest is not root
        if (largest != i) {
            int swap = arr[i];
            arr[i] = arr[largest];
            arr[largest] = swap;
 
            // Recursively heapify the affected sub-tree
            heapify(arr, N, largest);
        }
    }
